This file is the backend server file that runs on a separate process on the server via port 3001.
It runs on a cron job I created to schedule this process every minute each day to ensure the backend is always running. 

It receives all the API calls from the frontend, fetches data from the db connection to the mysql server created by me on the server

I am also responsible for the Inventory API calls, which take the request from the front end and fetch it through the database
and sends it back to the front end process that called it.
