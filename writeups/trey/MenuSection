Menu Section

Author: Trey Jones

Overview:
Menu section is the product page that shows all the stores' inventory. 
It is where users go to add to cart, and where admins go to modify and create items.

Users can also search for inventory by name and by description.
They can also sort inventory by name, price, and availability

/*
        Function: UseEffect
        - Use Effect is performed when the page first loads. 
*/

/* 
        Function: fetchData

        1) Fetch Data calls the api on the backend through axios
        2) This call goes to the backend process running on the server which handles
           all API calls.
        3) It parses through the JSON response data received, and sets two constant 
	   variables that hold the 
           state of the page. 
*/

/*
        Function: search
        1) It then resets the display inventory to show all items
        2) This sets up a temporary inventory list which will hold 
 	   the results that the user searched for
        3) It then sets the display inventory to be the inventory 
	   items that we populated in our temporary list that matched the search criteria
        
*/

/*
        Function: sortByName
        1) This sorts the inventory by the item name
        2) It uses temp list to populate all the currently 
	   displayed inventory and then sorts it, and sets it as the new display inventory
*/

/*
        Function: sortByPrice
        1) This sorts the inventory by the item price
        2) It uses temp list to populate all the currently 
	   displayed inventory and then sorts it, and sets it as the new display inventory
*/

/*
        Function: sortByAvailability
        1) This sorts the inventory by the item stock
        2) It uses temp list to populate all the currently 
	   displayed inventory and then sorts it, and sets it as the new display inventory
*/


/*
        Function: createItem

        - Simply navigates to the create item page
*/


/*
        Function: modifyItem

        - Simply navigates to the modify item page
*/



 /*
        Function(s): loading, loaded
        - sets the loading variable to ensure the page only loads once data is fetched
*/



//once data is done loading, it displays the page properly with all the inventory

The display inventory return statement cycles through all the displayInventory data
and maps each item to a box container with buttons. 

Those buttons will be different depending on the login data (admin, uid) that was passed in to the
page on load from app.jsx

if admin is 1, then there will not be an add to cart button, but rather a modify and create item
button for each displayed item.

If an item is out of stock, the add to cart button is disabled
and it says the item is out of stock.
