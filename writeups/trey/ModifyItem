ModifyItem:
This Page is where an is redirected when they click the modify item button.

The page loads and it parses the url for a parameter attached to the ModifyItem url: i.e. modifyItemCBD0001, where
CB0001 is the item Id of the product that needs to populate the fields in the modify item page. 

From there, the admin can modify any field in the table, and those fields will then be update when the admin clicks the update button.
upon update, it will redirect the admin back to the MenuSection page to view their change.

Function fetchData():
- Fetches the item from the database based on the url parameter passed in via API call to axios which hits the index.js backend

Function modifyItem():
1) Uploads any image that might be in the field 
2) passes all the fields in the inputs to the backend to run update query
3) name of image is stored in the database for late retrieval

Function uploadImage():
1) Creates a form data variable where we add the image name and the image file that's in the input field
2) Calls uploadImage API which again hits the index.js backend to save the image in the application directory on the server

Functions Loading and Loaded (see the MenuSection Page)

if the admin field passed into the page from app.jsx is null, it redirects back to the home page to make the page unaccessible
to users.

This page has a bunch of input fields that upon change, set the state variables that are passed to the update query when the 
user clicks update
