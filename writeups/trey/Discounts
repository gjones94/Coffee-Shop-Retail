Discounts

This is where admins are redirected to when the want to create or modify a discount.

Similar to the menu page, it populates all the discounts from the database.

The admin can create a discount by filling out the fields on the form and clicking create.

Each discount is displayed in a container box, and each box has a modify and delete button as well. 

When clicked, the button will populate the create/modify box with the discount's data to be modified 
and set the update boolean on the so that the correct call to update is made.

The functions fetchData, loaded, loading, addDiscount, modifyDiscount are all very similar in nature
to those described in the menuSection. Please refer to that section for further detail
